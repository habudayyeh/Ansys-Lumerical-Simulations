# Ansys Lumerical Simulations

This repository contains a collection of simulation files created using **Ansys Lumerical**, a powerful suite of photonic simulation tools. 
These are a collection of simulations I have conducted on  fundamental optical phenomena, light-matter interaction and photonic device design, for research purposes.

---
## Getting Started

To utilize these simulation files, you will need to have **Ansys Lumerical** installed on your system. Each simulation file (`.fsp`, `.lms`, `.lsf`, etc.) can be opened directly within the corresponding Lumerical environment (e.g., FDTD Solutions, MODE Solutions).
